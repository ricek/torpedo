# Student Attendance System
##### (designed for Bayside High School)

This is a senior project by Liang Gao, Xiang Li, Muchian Lee & Xicheng Zhou. Aiming to bring our school’s attendance system to the 21st century. Currently, schools are using paper attendance sheets to bubble in student’s attendance every day. This is time consuming and also a waste of paper.

The system is able to take the students’ attendance electronically by having the students swiping their ID card when they enter the classroom. A user friendly web portal is provided for parents to access theirchild’s real-time attendance online at any time and from anywhere. Immediate notification via text message or email are also available for parents based on their preferences.
